# Stompboard Project Memory

## Project Overview
- **Tech Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Headless UI
- **Purpose**: Display guitar pedal stomp board information with modern UI
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions to Vercel (free hosting)

## Key Features
1. **Pedal Management**: Each pedal is a JSON file in `pedals/` directory
2. **Dynamic Routing**: Each pedal gets a page at `/pedal-name` URL
3. **Search & Add**: Command system to find and add pedals via `npm run add-pedal`
4. **Modern UI**: Using Headless UI + Tailwind for responsive design

## Pedal JSON Structure
```json
{
  "name": "Pedal Name",
  "manufacturer": "Brand Name",
  "type": "fuzz|distortion|reverb|delay|overdrive|chorus|etc",
  "milliAmps": 50,
  "voltage": 9,
  "imageUrl": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "price": 199.99,
  "description": "Brief description",
  "controls": ["Volume", "Tone", "Gain"],
  "dimensions": "4.7\" x 2.6\" x 2.1\"",
  "weight": "0.5 lbs",
  "bypass": "True Bypass",
  "year": 2023
}
```

## Commands Available
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run add-pedal` - Interactive pedal search and add

## Development Notes
- Using React 18 concurrent features and Suspense
- TypeScript for type safety
- File-based routing for pedals
- Responsive grid layout for pedal overview
- Image lazy loading for performance

## Current Status
✅ Project structure created
✅ React 18 + TypeScript + Vite setup
✅ Tailwind CSS + Headless UI configured
✅ Sample pedal JSON created
✅ Interactive add-pedal script working
✅ GitHub Actions workflow for Vercel deployment
✅ All dependencies installed
✅ Development server ready

## Next Steps for User
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. Visit http://localhost:5173 to see the application
3. Use `npm run add-pedal` to add more pedals
4. Push to GitHub main branch to trigger deployment

## Known Limitations
- Pedal loading currently requires manual addition to utils/index.ts
- Search functionality in add-pedal script uses mock data
- Need to set up Vercel secrets for deployment
